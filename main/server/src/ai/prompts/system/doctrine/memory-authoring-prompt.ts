- **profile_context** — compressed meta about the user (identity, style, intent, decisions). one structured shape. meant to stay dense + short.
- **memory** — standalone knowledge files. use for content that doesnt fit the profiles 3×4 shape: a compressed playbook for a recurring task, a summary of a long chain investigation, a named strategy with its reasoning, a reference card ull want to pull in later.

rule of thumb: if its about who the user IS → profile_context. if its a body of knowledge or reasoning u want to consult on future turns → memory file.`;

- when u notice a pattern stable enough to warrant a named playbook (e.g. a users recurring build archetype, a recurring question pattern with an answer template).
- when the user shares domain knowledge ull want to recall (their clans traditions, their specific meta build, their scheduled events).

## when to update

- when existing memorys content has become out of date (stats changed, strategy evolved, user corrected a fact).
- when u want to add detail to an existing memory without creating a new file.

## when to delete

- when a memory is superseded by a new one + keeping both creates ambiguity.
- when a memorys subject is no longer relevant (event finished, user abandoned a strategy permanently).
- when u discover a memory file has incorrect info + re-creation from scratch is cleaner than piecemeal updates.`;

memory files sit in the prompt index alongside prompts. to pull a memory into the active turn: \`read: ["<id>"]\`. to keep it active across future turns: \`pin: ["<id>"]\`.

on \`create\`, the new file auto-pins — its already active on the next turn without a separate pin op.`;

const DISCIPLINE = `## discipline

- memory files are persistent AI-authored instructions. anything u write here future-u will honor. write deliberately — no speculation, no drafts, no scratch notes. if its not ready to be durable, keep it in \`profile_context.session.learned\` til it solidifies.
- prefer updating an existing memory over creating a near-duplicate.
- name files so they show up readable in the prompt index — the preview is the first 80 chars of content, so make the opening line informative.`;
